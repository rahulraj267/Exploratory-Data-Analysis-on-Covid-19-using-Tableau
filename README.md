# Exploratory Data Analysis on Covid - 19 

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on our lives and the world as a whole. One way to better understand this impact is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on COVID-19 data. In this project, we will use Python to analyze COVID-19 data and gain insights into the trends and patterns of the pandemic.

The project will involve the following steps: 

- Data collection: Collect COVID-19 data from reliable sources such as the World Health Organization (WHO) or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). We will use Python libraries such as pandas and NumPy to read, manipulate and preprocess the data. 
- Data cleaning: The collected data may contain inconsistencies, missing values, or outliers. We will clean the data by removing or imputing missing values and removing outliers.
- Data visualization: We will use Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to create various visualizations, such as line charts, bar charts, and heatmaps, to explore the trends and patterns of the pandemic. 
- Statistical analysis: We will use Python libraries such as SciPy and Statsmodels to perform statistical analysis, such as hypothesis testing and regression analysis, to identify the factors that affect the spread of COVID-19. 
- Machine learning: We will use Python libraries sush as Scikit-learn to build machine learning models, such as clustering and classification, to predict the spread of COVID-19 and identify the factors that contribute to its spread. 

The output of the project will be a report containing the insights gained from the data analysis and visualizations, along with the machine learning models predictions. We can use this report to gain insights into the pandemic's impact and help policymakers make informed decisions to combat the spread of COVID-19.
